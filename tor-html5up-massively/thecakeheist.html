								<p class="box">The Cake Heist
									It was late in the morning and an unpleasant sound echoed from downstairs. A sound that sought out the truth which cried, “Who ate my roll?” <br />
									<br />
									The night before had just been a marathon of online classes. Having been ganged up and tortured by three quizzes, I felt as if a vampire had sucked all my energy making me ready to drop dead into bed. Suddenly, a familiar sound growled from my stomach. A shameless midnight request. Getting up from my chair, my legs headed as if possessed to the magical box: the fridge. Scanning through the shelves, I spotted milk, vegetables, and meat, when it caught my eyes. <br />
									<br />
									“Ooh! A cream roll!” <br />
									<br />
									My stomach sent out another growl. I grabbed a spoon and viciously attacked my target. During that moment of blinding hunger, it never occurred to me that I should have asked myself, “where did this roll come from?” All I knew was that my creamy salvation was in front of me. What could go wrong? <br />
									<br />
									It was only when the last bite was gone that I realized the magnitude of my late-night robbery. “Wait! Where did this roll come from? ” The question bounced around in my head. Knowing my family's obsession with snacks, my spidey-sense told me this might not end well. I scrambled to the fridge to frame the scene and bury the evidence. I threw away the container behind the home, washed the spoon, and placed it in its tray. I headed to bed, hoping no one would find out. <br />
									<br />
									The next morning, the argument that I anticipated had already begun. <br />
									<br />
									 “Where is my roll?” asked my mom in a stern tone. <br />
									 <br />
									 “I didn’t eat it!” replied my brother. “It could have been Tor...” <br />
									 <br />
									I froze. The thought that I was going to be the next suspect interrogated triggered my fight-or-flight response. My brain went crazy for an acceptable answer. “I didn’t eat it. I ate some of it. I was the one who ate it. Sorry, it was me. I don’t know. What happened?” <br />
									<br />
									I walked downstairs trying to act oblivious. But like an eagle tracking its prey, my mom swooped down in front of me and asked: “Did you eat the roll?” <br />
									<br />
									My mother approached like a judge seeking justice. While I pretended to be innocent, shivers traveled down my spine. This was the moment where I had to choose between my family or my pride. It was like a see-saw. On one side, I saw myself honestly admitting being a thief and facing punishment. On the opposite end, I saw my other self refusing my actions as a selfish glutton. <br />
									<br />
									At that moment, my fear took over. I blurted out, “No … I don’t even know what you are talking about.” My voice was calm and I kept myself from making any suspicious movements. <br />
									<br />
									For a moment, she just looked at me, seemingly in deep thought. When she finally walked away, there was a sense she already knew who the culprit was. Without turning back, she just said calmly, “I just wanted to know if the cake was good. I don't mind if you ate it.” <br />
									<br />
									In place of the salvation I sought, I felt shame. The blindness from the pressure to save face and not appear gluttonous made me overlook an important fact. So what if I ate the roll? Being frank with my family who was there to embrace my shortcomings should have driven my decision. Next time I spot a snack in the fridge, I know it won’t have to become a crime scene. <br />
